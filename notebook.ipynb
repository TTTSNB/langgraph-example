    "    Section 1: Introduction to Docker\n",
    "    Docker is a platform designed to help developers build, ship, and run applications using containerization. \n",
    "    Containers allow for the encapsulation of an application and its dependencies into a single, portable unit. \n",
    "    This approach ensures that the application will run consistently across various environments, from a developerâ€™s \n",
    "    local machine to a production server. \n",
    "    Docker has revolutionized the way applications are deployed by enabling microservices architecture, where each \n",
    "    component of an application is isolated in its own container.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    Section 2: Docker Architecture\n",
    "    Docker architecture consists of several key components, including the Docker client, Docker daemon, images, \n",
    "    containers, and registries. The Docker client communicates with the Docker daemon, which performs the heavy \n",
    "    lifting of building, running, and managing containers. Images are templates used to create containers, and they \n",
    "    are stored in registries like Docker Hub. Containers are lightweight and portable encapsulations of an environment \n",
    "    in which applications run. By separating applications into containers, Docker helps improve resource utilization \n",
    "    and simplifies application management.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    Section 3: Working with Docker Commands\n",
    "    Docker provides a rich set of command-line tools to manage images, containers, networks, and volumes. \n",
    "    Some of the most commonly used commands include docker build, docker run, docker pull, docker push, and \n",
    "    docker-compose. The docker build command is used to create an image from a Dockerfile, while docker run is \n",
    "    used to start a container from an image. The docker-compose tool simplifies managing multi-container Docker \n",
    "    applications by allowing you to define and run them with a single command. However, this section does not \n",
    "    cover how to troubleshoot common errors that might occur while running these commands.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    Section 4: Best Practices for Using Docker\n",
    "    When using Docker in a production environment, it's essential to follow best practices to ensure security, \n",
    "    efficiency, and scalability. Some of the key practices include minimizing the number of layers in Docker images, \n",
    "    keeping images small, regularly scanning for vulnerabilities, and properly managing secrets. Additionally, it's \n",
    "    important to monitor container performance and set up automated processes for updating and deploying containers \n",
    "    to ensure that your application remains secure and performant.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    Section 5: Advanced Docker Networking\n",
    "    Dockerâ€™s networking capabilities allow containers to communicate with each other and with external networks. \n",
    "    By default, Docker provides several network drivers, such as bridge, host, and overlay, each suited to different \n",
    "    use cases. The bridge driver is used for standalone containers, allowing them to communicate on a single Docker \n",
    "    host. The overlay driver is used to connect containers across multiple Docker hosts, which is particularly useful \n",
    "    in a Docker Swarm or Kubernetes setup. Advanced users can also create custom networks to meet specific \n",
    "    application requirements. Unfortunately, the document does not explain how to debug networking issues, which \n",
